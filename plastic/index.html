             TIPS FOR REDUCING YOUR PLASTICS CONSUMPTION
            Minimising he consumption of plastics is much simpler than it seems. Here are some tips that can change your
            life and the life of the planet:
    
            Avoid single-use plastics such as drinking straws
            Single-use plastics, such as plates and cutlery made from this material, make our lives easier, but seriously
            harm the planet. These types of products have viable alternatives and there is an urgent need to chose these.
    
            If you go shopping, remember to take a cloth bag
            We go to the supermarket at least once a week to fill up our fridges. If every time we go we use reusable bags
            (cloth, string or wicker) the health of our planet will improve. From now on remember to take yours when leaving
            the house.
    
            Recycle chewing gum... it's also make of plastic!
            Most chewing gum currently on the market contains plastic. Try to buy less chewing gum and throw it in the
            correct recycling container. You can also opt for natural and organic chewing gums.
    
            Buy more bulk food and fewer packaged products
            Disposable containers are inundating supermarkets (polystyrene trays, PET bottles, tetra paks, plastic
            containers, etc.). But there is an alternative: more and more establishments are offering the possibility to buy
            in bulk.
